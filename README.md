# C-deep-learning  

I implemented deep learning network inference using C programming language.(including AlexNet, ResNet & VGGNet)  
## HOW TO USE  
use alexnet:

    make alexnet
    make inf_alexnet
use resnet:

    make resnet
    make inf_resnet
use vggnet:

    make vggnet
    make inf_vggnet
## DETAILS  
I realized convolution layer, activation layer, pooling layer and fully connected layer in this program.  
You can build your own network by using this module.
